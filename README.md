Introduction

This Python script simulates rolling two dice and analyzes the sum distribution. The goal is to transform the dice (Die A and Die B) while preserving the same sum probability distribution.

Features

Compute the sum distribution of two 6-sided dice.

Calculate probability distribution for each sum.

Transform dice to maintain the same probability distribution.

Generate a sum distribution matrix.
